Relevant Experience in Resume:**\n\n*   **Education:** Bachelor of Commerce, Marketing - Directly aligns with the requirement.\n*   **Experience:**\n    *   2 years of experience as a Marketing Assistant - Meets the minimum experience requirement.\n    *   Assisted with digital marketing campaigns including email and social media - Aligns with campaign execution responsibilities.\n    *   Created blog posts and social media updates - Demonstrates content creation skills.\n    *   Managed social media accounts and grew follower numbers - Shows social media management experience.\n*   **Skills:**\n    *   Digital Marketing (SEO basics, Email Marketing) - Partially aligns with SEO and Email Marketing requirements.\n    *   Social Media Tools (Hootsuite, Buffer) - Demonstrates practical experience with social media management.\n\n**3. Gaps/Mismatches:**\n\n*   **SEM:** No mention of Search Engine Marketing (SEM) experience.\n*   **Google Analytics:** No explicit mention of Google Analytics experience or preparing performance reports. While she \"assisted with digital marketing campaigns,\" the resume doesn't highlight her role in measuring and reporting on campaign performance.\n*   **Data Interpretation:** The resume doesn't showcase her ability to interpret marketing data.\n*   **CRM Systems:** No mention of experience with CRM systems like HubSpot.\n*   **Adobe Creative Suite:** Lists \"Basic knowledge of Adobe Photoshop,\" but the job description mentions \"Adobe Creative Suite\" which includes other programs such as Illustrator and InDesign.\n*   **Keyword Research:** No mention of experience with keyword research.\n*   **Specificity:** While the resume mentions \"assisting\" with campaigns, it lacks quantifiable achievements or specific examples of her contributions and impact.\n\n**4.
